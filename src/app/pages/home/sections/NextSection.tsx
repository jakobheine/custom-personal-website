          Welcome to My Homepage
          <br/><br/>
          Hello! I'm Jakob, a 26-year-old living in the beautiful city of Dresden with my fiancée and my dog. I work for Deloitte, specializing in product development on AWS.

          This website is still a work in progress. In true Continuous Deployment fashion, I’ll be updating it live as I make changes—so keep an eye out for new content! :P
          <br/><br/>
          I'm currently busy planning a wedding and enjoying the summer. More exciting updates will come as soon as I find the time!
          <br/><br/>
          So Long,
          <br/>
